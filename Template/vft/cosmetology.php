            <p>Cosmetic producers highly value VitaForest’s herbal, berry, fruit and mushroom powders for the fantastic characteristics of siberian areas. In nature, there are a huge amount of plants, berries, fruits and mushrooms which proved to be efficient during external application. However, it is Siberian nature that is deservedly considered a storehouse of the most valuable active components, which is confirmed by numerous scientific studies.</p>
            <p>Rhodiola rosea of Russian origin is added into creams and lotions as an effective agent for delaying aging due to high concentration of total rosavins (rosavin, rosarin, rosin) and salidroside in it. Siberian eleutherococcus contains a wide range of minerals which can be found only in that type of ginseng. It is used in cosmetic for skin care purposes. Nanain citronella hips are rich of E and C vitamins, minerals and essential oils and are natural antioxidants. Manchurian aralia rejuvenates, strengthens skin, improves it’s protection from external influences and recovers it elasticity and smoothes wrinkles.</p>
            <p>In cosmetic production Rhodiola rosea, chaga (Inonotus obliquus), milk thistle (Silybum marianum), purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea), siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus), Baikal skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis) and other siberian plant, berry, fruit and mushroom powders and extracts are used.</p>
